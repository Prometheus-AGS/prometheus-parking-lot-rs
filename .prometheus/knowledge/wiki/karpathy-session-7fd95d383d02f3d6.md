## Delta

`main` is synced to `472eb8a`, which includes #46.

#46 was merged while 11 of its 15 CI checks were still running. CI on `main` covers the same checks, and I'm watching that run now. If anything fails, I'll fix it before round 15 builds on top of it.

- **KBD:** cr-33's two implementation tasks are closed.
- **Stale lock:** I removed another empty git lock file from 13:51. No git process was holding it.
- **Still running:** cr-23 (multi-resource admission) and cr-39 (dependency cleanup).

## Root Cause

No explicit root-cause section was captured; preserve this as a session record, not an inferred diagnosis.

## Corrective Actions

Review and promote only reusable findings.
